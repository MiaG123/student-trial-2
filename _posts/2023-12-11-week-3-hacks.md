1. Open your reposatory in visual studio code
2. If you want a generic shape like a squar or cirle you can use codes such as
"<svg width="100" height="100">"
  "<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />"
"</svg>"
3. If you have a specific shape in mind use this code with a URL to the shape you would like to input
"![Shape](path/to/your/shape.svg)"
